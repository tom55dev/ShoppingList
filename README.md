# Shopping List App

A simple GraphQL-based Shopping List App developed using Go.

## Overview

This project exposes a GraphQL endpoint allowing users to perform CRUD operations on a shopping list. Each item in the shopping list has an ID, item name, description, count, and a purchased status. The app is designed to be easy to set up and run, and it serves as a foundation for anyone looking to get started with GraphQL in Go.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on shopping items.
- **Graphql Endpoint**: Interact with the app through a GraphQL endpoint.
- **Purchased Status Update**: Easily update the purchased status of a shopping item.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (1.16 or higher)

### Running the App

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/shopping-list-app.git
   cd shopping-list-app
   ```
   
2. Run the application:
   ```sh
   go run main.go
   ```

3. The GraphQL endpoint will be available at `http://localhost:8080/shoppinglist`.

## Usage

  }
}
```

### Mutations

mutation {
  addShoppingItem(itemName: "Milk", description: "1 Gallon", count: 2) {
    id
    itemName
    description
    count

  }
}
```

**Update a Shopping Item**
```graphql
mutation {
  updateShoppingItem(id: 1, itemName: "Milk", description: "1 Gallon", count: 2, purchased: true)
